# VITAI [Vocabulary Items To Anki Input]

Takes a list of English vocabulary words, looks up definitions etc., and creates a text file for Anki to import and create vocabulary cards with.
------------------------

Requirements to run the vitai.py:
  1) Setup config file -- it's straightforward, but you will need a wordnik API key, which is free.
  2) Have a vocabulary file with one, and only one, word per line.
